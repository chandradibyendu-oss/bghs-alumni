# Undo Attendance Functionality Test Plan

## Test Objectives
Verify that the undo attendance functionality works correctly for different scenarios:
1. Walk-in attendees (should delete registration on undo)
2. Regular registrations (should keep registration, clear attendance on undo)
3. Search functionality after undo
4. Statistics updates after undo

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Walk-in Attendee Undo
**Scenario:** User marks a walk-in as attended, then undoes it
**Expected Result:** Registration should be deleted, user should not appear in search results

### Test Case 2: Regular Registration Undo  
**Scenario:** User marks a regular registration as attended, then undoes it
**Expected Result:** Registration should remain, attendance should be cleared

### Test Case 3: Search After Undo
**Scenario:** After undoing attendance, search for the same user
**Expected Result:** Should reflect correct state (deleted vs cleared attendance)

### Test Case 4: Statistics Update
**Scenario:** Check dashboard statistics after undo operations
**Expected Result:** Statistics should update correctly

## Current Implementation Analysis
- Undo logic uses time-based detection (2 hours)
- Walk-ins: DELETE registration
- Regular: Keep registration, clear attendance

## Test Execution Plan
1. Check current database state
2. Test walk-in undo scenario
3. Test regular registration undo scenario  
4. Verify search functionality
5. Check statistics updates
6. Generate report
