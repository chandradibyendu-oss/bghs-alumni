# 🎉 Payment Workflow Integration - COMPLETE

## ✅ What Was Built (Phase 2 - Workflow Integration)

### 1. **Admin Approval → Payment Email** ✅
**File:** `app/api/admin/users/route.ts`

When an admin approves a user registration:
1. Checks if registration payment is required (from `payment_configurations` table)
2. Generates secure payment token (stored in `payment_tokens` table)
3. Creates payment link: `https://yoursite.com/payments/registration/{token}`
4. Queues email notification with payment link
5. Sets user's `payment_status` to `'pending'`

**Flow:**
```
Admin clicks "Approve" 
→ Check payment config (is registration payment active & mandatory?)
→ Generate secure token (72-hour expiry)
→ Create payment link
→ Send email to user
→ Mark user as "payment pending"
```

---

### 2. **Payment Verification → Account Activation** ✅
**File:** `lib/payment-service.ts`

When user completes payment:
1. Verifies RazorPay signature
2. Updates transaction status to `'success'`
3. Updates profile:
   - `payment_status` → `'completed'`
   - `registration_payment_status` → `'paid'`
   - `is_active` → `true` (ACTIVATES ACCOUNT)
4. Records transaction ID

**Flow:**
```
User pays via RazorPay
→ Payment verified
→ Transaction marked successful
→ User account ACTIVATED
→ Can now log in and access features
```

---

### 3. **Dashboard Payment Banner** ✅
**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

Users with `payment_status = 'pending'` see:
- **Prominent amber banner** at top of dashboard
- "Payment Pending" message
- "View Payment Details" button
- Instructions to check email

**Visual:**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ⚠️ Payment Pending                        ║
║  Your registration has been approved!      ║
║  Complete payment to activate account.     ║
║  [View Payment Details]                    ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

---

### 4. **Admin Payment Status Column** ✅
**File:** `app/admin/users/page.tsx`

Admins see payment status for each user:
- **Pending** (amber badge) - Payment link sent, awaiting payment
- **Paid** (green badge) - Payment completed
- **-** (gray) - No payment required

**Admin View:**
```
Name       | Approved | Payment | Actions
-----------|----------|---------|--------
John Doe   | ✓        | Pending | [Edit]
Jane Smith | ✓        | Paid    | [Edit]
Bob Jones  | ✗        | -       | [Edit]
```

## 📋 Complete Payment Workflow

### **Scenario: New User Registration**

#### **Step 1: User Submits Registration**
```
User fills registration form
↓
Creates profile with is_approved = false
↓
Waits for admin approval
```

#### **Step 2: Admin Approves**
```
Admin clicks "Approve" in /admin/users
↓
System checks: Is registration payment required?
├─ NO → User activated immediately
└─ YES → Proceed to payment workflow:
    ├─ Generate secure token (72-hour expiry)
    ├─ Create payment link: /payments/registration/{token}
    ├─ Queue email:
    │   Subject: "Registration Approved - Complete Payment"
    │   Body: Payment link, amount, expiry
    ├─ Set user.payment_status = 'pending'
    └─ User sees "Payment Pending" in dashboard
```

#### **Step 3: User Receives Email**
```
Email arrives with:
├─ Congratulations message
├─ Amount: ₹500 (or configured amount)
├─ [Pay Now] button → Payment link
└─ Valid for 72 hours
```

#### **Step 4: User Clicks Payment Link**
```
Opens: /payments/registration/{token}
↓
Token validated (not expired, not used)
↓
Shows payment page (NO LOGIN REQUIRED):
├─ User's name
├─ Amount to pay
├─ [Pay ₹500] RazorPay button
└─ Expiry countdown
```

#### **Step 5: User Completes Payment**
```
Clicks "Pay" → RazorPay opens
↓
Enters card/UPI/netbanking
↓
Payment success!
↓
Redirects to success page
↓
Backend processes:
├─ Verify RazorPay signature ✓
├─ Update transaction status → 'success'
├─ Update profile:
│   ├─ payment_status → 'completed'
│   ├─ is_active → true
│   └─ registration_payment_status → 'paid'
├─ Mark token as 'used'
└─ User account ACTIVATED!
```

#### **Step 6: User Can Now Access Site**
```
User logs in
↓
Dashboard shows: No payment banner (paid!)
↓
Full access to all features:
├─ Profile editing
├─ Events registration
├─ Gallery upload
└─ Directory access
```

## 🎯 Testing the Complete Workflow

### **Test Scenario: End-to-End Payment Flow**

1. **Setup Payment Configuration**
   ```
   Login as admin
   → Go to /admin/payments
   → Create "Registration" payment:
      Amount: 500
      Currency: INR
      Active: ✓
      Mandatory: ✓
   ```

2. **Create Test User** (or use existing pending user)
   ```
   Go to /admin/users
   → Create new user
   → User is created with is_approved = false
   ```

3. **Approve User**
   ```
   Click "Approve" button for the user
   → Check console logs: "[Payment Workflow] Payment link sent to..."
   → User's payment status changes to "Pending" (amber badge)
   ```

4. **Check Database** (Supabase)
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM payment_notification_queue WHERE user_id = '{user_id}';
   -- Should see email queued with payment link
   
   SELECT * FROM payment_tokens WHERE user_id = '{user_id}';
   -- Should see token with 72-hour expiry
   
   SELECT payment_status FROM profiles WHERE id = '{user_id}';
   -- Should show 'pending'
   ```

5. **Get Payment Link** (from database or email queue)
   ```
   Copy payment link from payment_notification_queue.metadata.payment_link
   → http://localhost:3000/payments/registration/{token}
   ```

6. **Test Payment Page** (as user - no login needed)
   ```
   Open payment link in incognito window
   → Should show user name, amount, pay button
   → Click "Pay ₹500"
   → Complete test payment with RazorPay
   → Redirected to success page
   ```

7. **Verify Account Activation**
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     is_active, 
     payment_status, 
     registration_payment_status 
   FROM profiles 
   WHERE id = '{user_id}';
   
   -- Should show:
   -- is_active: true
   -- payment_status: 'completed'
   -- registration_payment_status: 'paid'
   ```

8. **User Login**
   ```
   User logs in
   → Dashboard shows NO payment banner (paid!)
   → Full access granted
   ```
