# Payment Workflow - Next Steps

## 🎯 Where We Are

**Phase 1 Progress: 60% Complete**

✅ **Built:**
- URL utilities (environment-aware domains)
- Payment link token system
- Email template with payment link
- Token-based payment page (no login required)
- API endpoints for token validation

⏳ **Remaining:**
- Database table for tokens (SQL ready)
- Connect approval flow to send payment email
- Dashboard payment banner
- Profile update after payment

---

## 📋 **YOUR NEXT ACTION:**

### **Run This SQL Script in Supabase:**

**File:** `add-payment-tokens-table.sql`

**Steps:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy entire contents of `add-payment-tokens-table.sql`
4. Paste and Run
5. Should see: "✓ payment_tokens table created successfully"

**What it creates:**
- `payment_tokens` table for secure payment links
- Indexes for performance
- RLS policies
- Cleanup function for expired tokens

**Time:** 10 seconds

---

## 🚀 **AFTER YOU RUN SQL:**

### **Reply with:** "payment_tokens table created"

### **Then I Will:**

**1. Update Payment Verification** (5 min)
- After successful payment, update profile status
- Auto-activate user account
- Mark token as used

**2. Add Dashboard Payment Banner** (10 min)
- Check payment status when user logs in
- Show banner if payment pending
- "Pay ₹500 Now" button
- Fetch amount from configuration

**3. Connect Approval Flow** (15 min)
- Find where admin approval happens
- Add payment link generation
- Send email with payment link
- Set profile to 'payment_pending'

**4. Test Complete Workflow** (10 min)
- Create test user
- Admin approves
- Check email sent (console logs in dev)
- Click payment link
- Complete payment
- Verify account activated

---

## 🎯 **Expected Final Workflow:**

```
1. User Registers
   ↓
2. Admin Approves
   ↓ (Your SQL + My Integration)
3. System:
   - Fetches payment config (₹500)
   - Generates secure token
   - Creates payment link
   - Sends email: "Pay ₹500 Now"
   ↓
4. User Clicks "Pay Now" in Email
   → No login required
   → Opens payment page with ₹500
   ↓
5. User Completes Payment
   → Profile updated: status = 'paid'
   → Token marked as used
   → Account activated
   ↓
6. User Logs In
   → Full access granted
   → No payment banner (already paid)
   → Receipt in payment history
```
