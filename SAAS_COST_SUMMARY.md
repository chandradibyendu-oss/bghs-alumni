## Architecture Strategy

### Recommended: Hybrid Multi-Tenancy

**Shared Database + Row-Level Security**

**How it works:**
1. Single PostgreSQL database
2. Every table has `organization_id` column
3. RLS policies enforce data isolation
4. Tenant identified by subdomain (`schoolname.yoursaas.com`)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Cost-effective
- ✅ Easy to maintain
- ✅ Fast to implement
- ✅ Supabase native support
- ✅ Shared resource efficiency

**Scaling Path:**
- Start: Shared DB (10-500 tenants)
- Scale: DB sharding (500-2000 tenants)
- Enterprise: Dedicated DB instances (custom pricing)

## Key Technical Changes

### Database Changes

**New Tables:**
1. `organizations` - Tenant management

3. `subscriptions` - Tenant subscriptions
4. `usage_metrics` - Pay-as-you-go tracking
5. `tenant_settings` - Per-tenant configuration
6. `feature_flags` - Feature control

**Existing Tables:**
- Add `organization_id` to ALL tables (20+ tables)
- Update RLS policies
- Create indexes for performance

### Application Changes

**New Features:**
1. Tenant context middleware
2. Organization switching
3. Self-service onboarding
