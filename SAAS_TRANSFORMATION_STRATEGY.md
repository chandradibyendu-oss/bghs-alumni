# SaaS Transformation Strategy
## BGHS Alumni System ‚Üí Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform

**Current Status:** Single-tenant alumni management system  
**Target:** Multi-tenant SaaS platform for schools/universities  
**Business Model:** Pay-as-you-go subscription model

---

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### **Transformation Scope**
Converting the existing single-tenant system into a multi-tenant SaaS platform where multiple schools/universities can use the same platform with complete data isolation, custom branding, and independent billing.

### **Timeline Overview**
- **Phase 1 (Architecture):** 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Core Multi-tenancy):** 4-6 weeks
- **Phase 3 (Billing & Subscriptions):** 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 4 (Admin Portal):** 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 5 (Testing & Launch):** 2-3 weeks
- **Total:** 13-19 weeks (3-5 months)

### **Estimated Cost**
- **Development:** ‚Çπ8-12 lakhs ($9,600-$14,400)
- **Infrastructure Year 1:** ‚Çπ1-2 lakhs ($1,200-$2,400)
- **Total:** ‚Çπ9-14 lakhs ($10,800-$16,800)

---

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE STRATEGY

### **Multi-Tenancy Approach: HYBRID MODEL (Recommended)**

#### **Option A: Shared Database + Row-Level Isolation** ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED
**How it works:**
- Single database with `tenant_id` column in every table
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforce data isolation
- Shared infrastructure, isolated data

**Pros:**
- Cost-effective for small-medium scale
- Easy to maintain and upgrade
- Better resource utilization
- Supabase already supports RLS

**Cons:**
- Potential noisy neighbor issues at scale
- All tenants affected if database goes down
- Complex RLS policies

**Best for:** 10-500 schools

---

#### **Option B: Database-per-Tenant**
**How it works:**
- Each school gets its own database
- Complete isolation
- Tenant routing at application layer

**Pros:**
- Complete data isolation
- Easy to backup/restore per tenant
- No noisy neighbor issues
- Better for compliance

**Cons:**
- Higher infrastructure costs
- Harder to maintain (schema updates)
- More complex deployment

**Best for:** Enterprise clients, 100+ schools with high compliance needs

---

#### **Option C: Schema-per-Tenant (PostgreSQL)**
**How it works:**
- One database, separate schema for each tenant
- Moderate isolation

**Pros:**
- Good balance of isolation and cost
- Easier than database-per-tenant

**Cons:**
- PostgreSQL specific
- Schema migration complexity
- Resource sharing issues

---

### **üéØ RECOMMENDED: Hybrid Approach**

**Start with Option A (Shared DB + RLS), with architecture ready for Option B**

**Tenant Routing Strategy:**
1. **Subdomain-based:** `schoolname.yoursaas.com`
2. **Custom domain:** `alumni.schoolname.edu` (CNAME to your platform)
3. **Path-based:** `yoursaas.com/schoolname` (not recommended)

---

## üîë KEY ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES

### **1. TENANT MANAGEMENT**

#### **New Database Tables:**

```sql
-- Organizations (Tenants)
CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  subdomain TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,  -- schoolname.yoursaas.com
  custom_domain TEXT UNIQUE,        -- alumni.school.edu
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT,                        -- school, university, college
  status TEXT,                      -- active, suspended, trial, cancelled
  plan_id UUID,                     -- subscription plan
  branding JSONB,                   -- logo, colors, theme
  settings JSONB,                   -- feature flags, limits
  owner_user_id UUID,               -- Super admin of this tenant
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  trial_ends_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  subscription_ends_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Subscription Plans
CREATE TABLE subscription_plans (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,                        -- Free, Basic, Premium, Enterprise
  price_monthly DECIMAL,
  price_yearly DECIMAL,
  currency TEXT DEFAULT 'INR',
  features JSONB,                   -- {max_users: 100, max_storage_gb: 10, ...}
  limits JSONB,                     -- {max_events: 50, max_gallery_photos: 1000}
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Subscriptions
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  plan_id UUID REFERENCES subscription_plans(id),
  status TEXT,                      -- active, past_due, cancelled, trialing
  current_period_start TIMESTAMPTZ,
  current_period_end TIMESTAMPTZ,
  razorpay_subscription_id TEXT,    -- RazorPay recurring subscription
  cancel_at_period_end BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
);

-- Usage Tracking (for pay-as-you-go)
CREATE TABLE usage_metrics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  metric_type TEXT,                 -- users, storage_gb, events, emails_sent
  quantity INTEGER,
  period_month TEXT,                -- 2025-10
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

#### **Modify Existing Tables:**

Add `organization_id` to EVERY table:

```sql
-- Example: profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id);

-- Create index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_org ON profiles(organization_id);

-- Update RLS policies
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users see only their org data" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (
    organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id')::uuid
  );
```

**Tables to modify:**
- profiles (users)
- events
- event_registrations
- blog_posts
- donations
- donation_causes
- gallery_photos
- payment_transactions
- payment_configurations
- payment_notification_queue
- newsletters
- etc.

  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Organization Admins
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Department Heads (if needed)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Alumni Members
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Public Users
```

#### **Enhanced Auth Flow:**

```typescript
// Current: User logs in ‚Üí Gets role ‚Üí Access granted
// New: User logs in ‚Üí Gets organization ‚Üí Gets role in that org ‚Üí Access granted

interface UserSession {
  userId: string;
  organizationId: string;        // NEW
  organizationRole: string;      // NEW: role in THIS organization
  platformRole?: string;         // NEW: platform-level role (if any)
  permissions: string[];
}
```

#### **Key Changes:**
1. **Tenant Context Middleware:** Identify tenant from subdomain/domain
2. **Organization Switching:** Users who manage multiple schools can switch
3. **Scoped Permissions:** Permissions are per-organization
4. **Super Admin Portal:** Separate admin area for platform management
