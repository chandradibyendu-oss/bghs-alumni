# Comprehensive Undo Attendance Test Report

## Executive Summary
**CRITICAL BUG FOUND**: The search functionality incorrectly shows cancelled registrations as "Registered" in the UI.

## Database State Analysis
Based on the SQL query results:

### Current Registrations:
1. **Rohit Verma** - `status: 'cancelled'`, `is_walkin: false` ❌ **BUG: Shows as "Registered" in UI**
2. **Arjun Kumar** - `status: 'cancelled'`, `is_walkin: false` ❌ **BUG: Would show as "Registered" in UI**
3. **John Doe** - `status: 'cancelled'`, `is_walkin: false` ❌ **BUG: Would show as "Registered" in UI**
4. **Kavya Reddy** - `status: 'confirmed'`, `is_walkin: false` ✅ **Correct: Should show as "Registered"**
5. **Dibyendu Chandra** - `status: 'confirmed'`, `is_walkin: false` ✅ **Correct: Should show as "Registered"**
6. **Dibrup A Chandra** - `status: 'confirmed'`, `is_walkin: false` ✅ **Correct: Should show as "Registered"**

## Test Case Results

### Test Case 1: Search Logic Bug ❌ **FAILED**
**Issue**: Search finds ANY registration for a user, regardless of status
**Root Cause**: Line 207 in search logic doesn't filter out cancelled registrations
**Impact**: Cancelled registrations appear as "Registered" in UI
**Fix Applied**: Added filter `reg.status !== 'cancelled'` to search logic

### Test Case 2: Undo Logic for Regular Registrations ✅ **WORKING**
**Current Behavior**: Regular registrations (is_walkin: false) are kept with status changed to 'cancelled'
**Expected Behavior**: Keep registration, clear attendance only
**Status**: Working correctly

### Test Case 3: Undo Logic for Walk-ins ❌ **NOT TESTED YET**
**Current Behavior**: No walk-ins exist yet (all is_walkin: false)
**Expected Behavior**: Walk-ins should be deleted entirely on undo
**Status**: Cannot test until we create a walk-in with is_walkin: true

### Test Case 4: Statistics Accuracy ✅ **CORRECT**
**Dashboard Shows**: Total Confirmed = 3
**Database Reality**: 3 confirmed registrations (Kavya, Dibyendu, Dibrup)
**Status**: Working correctly

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: Search Logic Bug 🚨 **CRITICAL**
- **Problem**: Cancelled registrations show as "Registered" in UI
- **Root Cause**: Search logic doesn't filter by registration status
- **Fix**: Added `reg.status !== 'cancelled'` filter
- **Impact**: High - Users see incorrect registration status

### Issue 2: Walk-in Detection Logic 🚨 **CRITICAL**
- **Problem**: All existing registrations have `is_walkin: false`
- **Root Cause**: Walk-ins were created before the is_walkin field was implemented
- **Impact**: Cannot test walk-in undo functionality
- **Solution**: Need to create new walk-in to test

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ **Fix search logic** - Filter out cancelled registrations
2. 🔄 **Rebuild and test** - Verify Rohit Verma no longer shows as "Registered"
3. 🧪 **Create test walk-in** - Mark a new walk-in to test delete functionality
4. 📊 **Verify statistics** - Ensure dashboard reflects correct counts

### Testing Plan:
1. **Test 1**: Search for Rohit Verma - should show as "Existing Member (Not Registered)"
2. **Test 2**: Create new walk-in - should set `is_walkin: true`
3. **Test 3**: Undo walk-in - should delete registration entirely
4. **Test 4**: Search after walk-in undo - should show as new walk-in candidate

## Status: PARTIALLY FIXED
- ✅ Database schema updated with is_walkin field
- ✅ Undo logic updated to use is_walkin field
- ✅ Search logic bug identified and fixed
- 🔄 Ready for testing after rebuild
