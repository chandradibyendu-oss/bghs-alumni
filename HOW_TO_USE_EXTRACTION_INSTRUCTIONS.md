# How to Use Bengali Extraction Instructions

## 📁 Files Created

I've created **3 instruction files** for you to use:

1. **`BENGALI_EXTRACTION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** - Complete detailed documentation
2. **`EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE.txt`** - Standard template to copy-paste
3. **`QUICK_EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE.txt`** - Quick reference card (recommended)

## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended Method)

### Step 1: Copy the Quick Template
Open `QUICK_EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE.txt` and copy its contents.

### Step 2: Paste with Your Image
Each time you have a new Bengali image:

1. Copy the entire content from `QUICK_EXTRACTION_TEMPLATE.txt`
2. Paste it in your message to me
3. **Update the filename** (e.g., change `180-210.csv` to your actual range)
4. **Update the "Current Status" section** with the last uploaded file info
5. Attach your Bengali image
6. Send!

### Example Usage:
```
Extract alumni data from the attached Bengali text image.

Create 180-210.csv with all entries extracted correctly.

Requirements:
✓ Use EXACT format from: 57-86.csv, 87-117.csv, 118-148.csv, or 149-179.csv
✓ Extract ALL entries - NO placeholder names (like "Name180")
✓ Transliterate Bengali names accurately to English
... (rest of template)

Current Status:
- Last file: 149-179.csv
- Last entry: 179
- Last registration: BGHSA-2025-00181
- Next file (180+) should start with: BGHSA-2025-00182
```

## 📊 Current Status (Update After Each Upload)

After uploading a new CSV file, update the "Current Status" section:

- **Last file:** [filename].csv
- **Last entry:** [last entry number]
- **Last registration:** [last registration number]
- **Next file should start with:** [next registration number]

**Example after uploading 149-179.csv:**
```
Current Status:
- Last file: 149-179.csv
- Last entry: 179
- Last registration: BGHSA-2025-00181

- ✅ **Efficiency** - No back-and-forth clarification needed
- ✅ **Quality** - No placeholder names, proper extraction
- ✅ **Speed** - Quick copy-paste, instant understanding

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep the template file open** - Easier to copy-paste each time
2. **Double-check the filename** - Make sure it matches your entry range
3. **Verify current status** - Check last uploaded file before updating status
4. **One image per request** - Process one image at a time for best results

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: What if my image has entries 180-220?**
A: Update the filename to `180-220.csv` in the template

**Q: How do I know the next registration number?**
A: Last registration was BGHSA-2025-00181 (for entry 179). Entry 180 = 180+2 = 182, so use BGHSA-2025-00182

**Q: What if the image quality is poor?**
A: Still use the same template - I'll extract what I can and let you know if anything is unclear

**Q: Can I process multiple images at once?**
A: Better to do one at a time for accuracy, but you can attach multiple images with separate filenames
